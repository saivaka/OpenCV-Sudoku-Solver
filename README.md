# Sudoku Solver
## Sai Vaka, Aniket Nedunuri, Ankith Palakodati
This project aims to create an automated Sudoku solver that can take an image of an unsolved Sudoku puzzle, recognize the digits, and efficiently provide the solution. The solver utilizes computer vision techniques to preprocess the image, extract individual cells, and apply a neural network to classify the digits. The puzzle is then solved using a backtracking algorithm.

## Approach
The project follows a step-by-step process:
1. Image Processing: Apply filters and thresholding techniques to enhance contrast between digits, borders, and the background.
2. Border Identification: Use contouring techniques to detect the puzzle's border.
3. Corner Detection: Find the corners of the puzzle using the approxPolyDP algorithm.
4. Board Splitting: Isolate the Sudoku board using a homography transformation and split the image into 81 equal square cells.
5. Digit Classification: Pass each cell of the board through a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset to identify the digits.
6. Puzzle Solving: Utilize a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle based on the classified digits.


## Experiments
For training and testing the robustness of the digit recognition component of the neural network, a diverse dataset of digit images were collected from the MNIST dataset. The success of the project was measured through metrics such as accuracy of digit recognition on isolated cells, success rate of puzzle solving compared to random chance, and correctness of the solved puzzles.

## Usage
Run the Preprocess.py script, providing the path to an image of an unsolved Sudoku puzzle. The script will preprocess the image with filters and contouring, classify the digits, solve the puzzle, and display the solved puzzle on the terminal. Results. The project demonstrates significant advancements in computer vision techniques, aided by sophisticated algorithms, large training datasets, and improved computational power. The combination of image processing, machine learning, and backtracking techniques enables efficient and accurate Sudoku puzzle solving.

### Future Enhancements:
-Make the program accept an image as an arg input instead of manually entering path in the source code   
-Add a requirements.txt file of any needed installations to run the script    
-Improve the robustness of the OpenCV filtering and digit recognition neural network model to handle variations in lighting, angles, and image quality.   
-Potentially print the digits back onto the board image provide by the user
